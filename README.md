# FetchExercise
Exercise for Fetch interview 
Hello! This is my take home exercise for Data Analyst role for Fetch. A few things to note about the files here:
FetchRewardsDiagram.pdf - shows my db diagram that I proposed for post-cleanup. I created a centralized fact table called "transactionfact", I also proposed
to breakout the information in the receipts list field into a separate table. 

FetchExercise.pynb - shows all of the data cleaning, a bulk of my work as well as what my thought process was throughout. 

SnowflakeSQL - the raw snowflake SQL I am also attaching a few images of what I did. I used basic SQL to answer the question and used the create table/load data 
through built in CSV. 

StakeholderCommunication - the simplified message I would send over Slack to address some of the next steps I have for the process. 

I also uploaded the "clean" files from the python code. 

Thanks for this opportunity!

Best,

Caleb
