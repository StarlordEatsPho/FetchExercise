Hello (stakeholder), 

Hope this email finds you well. My name is Caleb Basu, a data analyst on David's team. I was going through some of our receipt and user data to try and answer some
of our high priority business questions. Overall, I think we have a few issues and data housekeeping we will need to do before I can confidently answer. If we can
work together on this, I would love to propose some next steps:

1. Can we confirm where and how this data is being pulled? I found several duplicate, missing values, and improperly formatted fields in the raw data. If this is how
we are currently pulling information out, I would like to propose a potential alternative solution using Snowflake. It would be great to include the data engineering
team in this as well as I think there is an opportunity to optimize our current process.

2. To answer your initial questions, it looks like we have not "Accepted" status in our receipt status field. Currently we are tracking "Submitted" and "Finished" as
potential options. Based on your initial question I did some initial digging, it looks like "Finished" status receipts have the largest number of items purchased. 
However, I would like to caveat, that I am not 100% confident in that answer, and would need some answer to the first question before confirming. There are also
a few other fields that are supposed to be stagnant (i.e. our 'role' field should be set to "consumer" but it has "fetch-staff" also).

I have attached my initial insights, but I think at this point the best next step would be to schedule a meeting with the various stakeholders in this project. I 
would love to learn more about how this data is being pulled, what I can do to help, and see if we can get you the answers you are looking for accurately and as 
soon as possible. Will talk soon.

Have a great weekend,

Thanks!

Caleb
